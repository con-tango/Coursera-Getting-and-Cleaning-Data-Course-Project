# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
============================================
This repository contains the R code and documentation files for the Coursera' course "Getting and Cleaning data" for Data Science specialisation.

Used dataset: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains the script to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. It can be executed in R by just importing the file.
